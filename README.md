The .boi Compressor

Welcome!
You’re probably here for the star of the show:

The very cool, extremely advanced, definitely‐not-cursed .boi compressor and decompressor.

Right now it supports Linux and windows. 

What Does It Do?

This tool lets you:

Compress files into the .boi format
Smaller size, still the same file… just more boi-ified. (No i dont steal ur files)

Decompress files back to their original state
No loss, no weird corruption (hopefully).

Performance-wise, it beats ZIP and RAR, and performs similarly to 7-Zip.
Pretty solid for a brand-new format that no one else uses yet.

That also means:
Your .boi files are basically invisible to the rest of the world.
More privacy. More mystery. More boi.

How to Use

Run the script called FuckAssThingyTest from the repo.
Yes, the name is intentional. Yes, it’s amazing.

It will automatically open your default browser.

You’ll see a super simple interface with two buttons:

Compress

Decompress

Pick what you want to do, choose your file, and boom — magic.

The interface runs locally using localhost, so it works offline.

Important Notes

Closing the browser does not stop the program.
To fully close it, you need to manually end the process (Task Manager/System Monitor).

It should run fine on most Linux/Windows setups.
If it doesn’t… that’s because computers are weird.

Why .boi?

Why not?
